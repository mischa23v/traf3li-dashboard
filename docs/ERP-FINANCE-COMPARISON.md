**TRAF3LI's finance module is enterprise-grade** and in several areas **surpasses** what even Odoo Enterprise offers out-of-the-box. The Saudi Arabia-specific compliance features (ZATCA, GOSI, SADAD, WPS, Nitaqat) represent a **major competitive advantage** that would require expensive third-party plugins or custom development in any competitor ERP.
