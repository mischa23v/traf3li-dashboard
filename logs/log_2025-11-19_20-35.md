## Objective
Redesign the "Overview" dashboard to be a comprehensive hub for a Lawyer, aggregating data from all system modules (Cases, Finance, Communication, Jobs, Training, Calendar).

## Requirements
The dashboard must show the "most important parts" of every feature:
1.  **Cases**: Active count, upcoming sessions.
2.  **Calendar**: Today's schedule, reminders.
3.  **Finance**: Revenue (last month), outstanding invoices.
4.  **Communication**: Unread messages, recent chats.
5.  **Jobs/Opportunities**: New job matches or service requests.
6.  **Training/Knowledge**: Recommended courses or legal updates.
7.  **Clients**: New client acquisition.

## Design Plan
-   **Hero**: Personalized greeting with quick summary.
-   **Stats Row**: Key metrics (Revenue, Active Cases, New Clients, Unread Messages).
-   **Main Grid**:
    -   **Schedule & Tasks**: A timeline view of the day.
    -   **Finance Overview**: A summary card with a mini-chart or key figures.
    -   **Recent Messages**: A list of recent conversations.
    -   **Opportunities & Knowledge**: A combined section for professional growth (Jobs + Training).
-   **Style**: GOSI Design System (Deep Navy, Blue Accents, Rounded-3xl, Arabic).

## Action Items
1.  Rewrite `src/features/dashboard/index.tsx` with this new layout.
2.  Mock data for all sections.
