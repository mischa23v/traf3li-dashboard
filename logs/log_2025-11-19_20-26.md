## Objective
Revert the dashboard to the "Lawyer/MyCase" style (Cases, Urgent Tasks, Sessions) but improve the design using the GOSI Design System.

## Plan
1.  **Revert**: Restore the content from `CasesDashboard.tsx` into `src/features/dashboard/index.tsx`.
    -   Hero Banner: "Good Morning Meshari", Session/Task counts.
    -   Urgent Tasks: "Defense Memo Preparation".
    -   Filters: Case Type, Lawyer, Status.
    -   Cases Grid: List of active cases with status, time, and location.
2.  **Improve**:
    -   Use `bg-navy` for the Hero section.
    -   Use `rounded-3xl` for cards.
    -   Ensure `IBM Plex Sans Arabic` font.
    -   Refine the "Urgent Tasks" card to be more prominent.
    -   Add "Quick Actions" (Add Case, Calendar) in a clean way.
3.  **Sidebar**: Already updated to Lawyer structure in previous steps.

## Context
The user wants a "MyCase" like experience for lawyers, not the "Individual" GOSI dashboard.
